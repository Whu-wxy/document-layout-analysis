1. Change image path  in main.py

2. Run the application: python main.py. It will create a folder named "output_yourfilename".



In this fork project, I add code to distinguish image and text region only in the "process_par".



The application is a simple document layout analysis using Python-OpenCV. Using three images, the program needs to do the following:

1. Individual characters are boxed
2. Individual words are boxed
3. Lines are boxed
3. Paragraphs are boxed
3. The paragraphs with margins
